## About Adjuvo

Adjuvo is the **gamified collaboration hub** connecting builders and apps across the Hedera ecosystem.  
It transforms every contribution into **on-chain value** — certified, rewarded, and recorded on the Hashgraph.  

Through **missions, quests, and badges**, builders earn **HBAR** and build verifiable reputations, while apps access qualified talent and transparent results. Together, they fuel Hedera’s growth — creating a living, self-sustaining economy where participation drives innovation.  

Set in a cyberpunk-inspired universe, Adjuvo turns collaboration into a **game** — fast, open, and permissionless. Here, code becomes currency, and every mission strengthens the network.  

**The ultimate engine for the Hedera ecosystem.**

## How It Works

### 1. App Verification & Mission Creation
- Apps are verified by the Adjuvo team to ensure they are serious projects.  
- Approved apps create missions with **HBAR rewards** and define mission details.  
- Apps can communicate with builders via the mission chat while remaining free to coordinate externally.  

### 2. Builder Onboarding & Certification
- Builders must complete **Hedera development certification** to access missions.  
- Adjuvo guides beginners step-by-step — no one is blocked.  
- Certified builders browse missions and apply to those matching their skills.  

### 3. Mission Collaboration & Reward
- When an app accepts a builder, collaboration begins.  
- At mission completion, the app validates the work and releases the **HBAR reward**.  
- Proof of mission is stored on **Hashgraph via HIP-991**.  
- Adjuvo automatically generates:
  - NFT receipt for the builder as proof of payment  
  - NFT reward for the app as recognition and incentive  

### 4. Gamification & Reputation
- Builders earn **points, XP, and leaderboard positions** for completed missions.  
- Leveling up unlocks new missions, exclusive NFT rewards, and bonuses.  
- Gamified incentives drive skill growth, engagement, and visibility in the ecosystem.
